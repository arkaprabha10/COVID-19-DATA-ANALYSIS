1. 5 COUNTRIES taken : India, Israel, NZ ,USA and Italy
2. For total cases per million we observe :

	C. Worrisome for India and USA bcause high values as compared to poulation
3. Similar trend for new cases per million. India is rising now
4. For total cases USA and India surprass by a huge margin due to high population and bad control
4. New cases per day - Ideally a peak and die out. But here we have multiple peaks because infected not 0
	a. India is rising at a huge pace
	b. Italy has a late peak beacause govt measures before but people flouted so a lag
	c. USA has multiple peaks because everytime it managed to control, restrictions lifted
